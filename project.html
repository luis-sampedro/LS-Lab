              This project builds a full digital model of an International Moth dinghy
              inside <strong>Simulator in Motion (SiM)</strong>, a Dynamic Velocity Prediction
              Program (DVPP) based sailing simulator. The platform is used to benchmark
              against D3-VPP® targets and to study two flight-control approaches:
              a mechanical wand and a heave PID controller.

    <!-- ABSTRACT (INTACT) -->
    <section id="abstract" class="section">
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The design of high-performance sailing craft has shifted from experience-driven iteration
        to data-driven workflows based on 3D modelling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
        and velocity prediction programmes (VPP). Hydro-foiling introduces inherently dynamic
        behaviours that exceed the scope of steady VPPs, motivating dynamic-DVPPs and simulators
        derived from them for design and training in America’s Cup (AC) and other high-performance
        contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This thesis implements an International Moth inside Simulator In Motion (SiM)—a
        DVPP-based sailing simulator—aligning geometry, mass properties and aero/hydro models,
        and establishing a workflow to compare predicted performance and controller behaviour
        across configurations. Simulations were executed in this independent environment, while
        D3-VPP® targets and the Exploder MD3 geometry supplied by D3 Applied Technologies, S.L. (D3)
        defined the reference conditions and baseline configuration. The work first benchmarks SiM
        against D3-VPP targets at two representative operating points (best-VMG upwind and downwind,
        TWS = 14 kn), then exercises two flight-control approaches: (i) a mechanical wand (sensitivities
        to gearing and wand length) and (ii) a heave PID (sensitivities to Kp, Ki and Kd), in flat
        water and a simple regular sea state.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simulator reproduces the VPP targets within ∼ 1% (speeds and VMGs), with attitudes close to
        target and force balances coherent at both points, supporting its credibility for controller
        studies in the tested envelope. For the wand, lower-response gearing attenuates wave-induced
        oscillations without degrading mean ride height, and increased wand length primarily biases
        the mean flight level while preserving a common steady wand angle. For the PID, a moderate
        tuning (baseline near Kp ≈ 4, Ki ≈ 2–3, Kd ≈ 6) offers the best compromise between rise time
        and damping; relative to the wand the PID shortens settling and improves disturbance rejection
        in both flat and waves. Notably, electronic ride-height control is currently prohibited by the
        International Moth Class Rules, restricting such benefits to non-official contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the platform meets its objectives: it (i) matches VPP targets credibly at 14 kn
        upwind/downwind, (ii) captures expected controller trends (gearing, wand length, PID gains),
        and (iii) provides a practical, repeatable bench for flight-control development. Future work
        should broaden the envelope (TWS/TWA and irregular seas), refine wand mechanism modelling,
        and test crew dynamics and manoeuvres.

    <!-- INTRODUCTION SUMMARY -->
    <section id="intro" class="section section-alt">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Testing and developing components for foiling and high-performance boats is
        expensive and risky. Wind and waves constantly change, which makes it hard
        to compare configurations under controlled conditions. The International Moth,
        one of the most demanding foiling dinghies, is an ideal test case to explore
        how a DVPP-driven simulator can support design and control development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thesis defines three specific objectives:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <strong>O1 – Test platform:</strong> build a stable International Moth
          test platform inside SiM that can reproduce D3-VPP performance
          at key operating points using three PIDs (heel, TWA and heave).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>O2 – Mechanical wand model:</strong> model the real wand-flap
          flight-control system inside the simulator and study the sensitivity
          to gearing and wand length using responses such as foil immersion,
          wand angle and VMG.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>O3 – Comparison:</strong> compare the PID-based and wand-based
          flight-control systems, identifying benefits, drawbacks and use cases
          for each approach.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- BACKGROUND SUMMARY -->
    <section id="background" class="section">
      <h2>2. Background &amp; Literature Review</h2>
      <p>
        The background chapter starts with a short history of hydrofoils, from early
        experiments in the 19th and early 20th century to modern high-speed craft.
        It then reviews the basic sailing mechanics needed to understand the Moth:
        the wind triangle, force balances in the horizontal plane (XY) and vertical
        plane (YZ), and the role of foils, rig and hull.
      </p>
      <p>
        A specific section is devoted to the <strong>International Moth Class Rules</strong>
        and to the mechanics of the <strong>flight-control system</strong>: bow-mounted wand,
        linkage, gearing, ride-height offset and rudder-rake mechanism. Finally, the
        chapter discusses classical <strong>Velocity Prediction Programs</strong> (VPP),
        their limitations in dynamic foiling regimes, and how DVPP-based simulators
        like SiM extend these tools into the time domain.
      </p>

    <!-- METHODOLOGY & SIMULATOR -->
    <section id="methodology" class="section section-alt">
      <h2>3. Methodology &amp; Simulator Setup</h2>
      <p>
        The methodology chapter explains how the International Moth was translated
        into digital form. The work starts from geometry and mass properties (based
        on the Exploder MD3 configuration) and applies specialised physics models
        for foils, hull, rig, rudder and windage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside <strong>Simulator in Motion (SiM)</strong>, the project configures:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>SiM_Data</strong> – project folders, input files and data streams.</li>
        <li><strong>Yacht Manager</strong> – high-level configuration of the Moth model.</li>
        <li><strong>Yacht Model</strong> – detailed physics models and 6-DOF dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>INPUTS/MOTH</strong> – custom files for appendages, rig and controllers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A step-by-step workflow links D3-VPP polars and VMG targets with SiM runs,
        making sure that both tools use consistent geometry, mass and operating
        conditions before any controller study is carried out.
      </p>

    <!-- BENCHMARKING vs VPP -->
    <section id="benchmarking" class="section">
      <h2>4. Benchmarking against D3-VPP</h2>
      <p>
        Before using the simulator as a flight-control test bench, the model is
        benchmarked against <strong>D3-VPP</strong> at two representative conditions:
        best-VMG upwind and best-VMG downwind at TWS = 14 kn.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each operating point, the study compares:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Boat speed and VMG.</li>
        <li>Heel and pitch attitudes.</li>
        <li>Force and moment balances.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The SiM outputs match D3-VPP targets within around 1% in speed and VMG,
        and reproduce coherent attitudes and load distributions. This gives
        confidence that the simulator is a credible environment for controller
        studies within the tested envelope.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- FLIGHT CONTROL STUDIES + VIDEOS -->
    <section id="flight-control" class="section section-alt">
      <h2>5. Flight-Control System Studies</h2>
      <p>
        Once the base Moth model is validated, the project focuses on the
        <strong>flight-control system</strong>. Two families of controllers are studied:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <strong>Mechanical wand system:</strong> a bow-mounted wand sensing
          ride height, linked to the main-foil flap through rods and bell cranks,
          with adjustable gearing, length and ride-height offset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heave PID controller:</strong> an electronic proportional–integral–
          derivative controller acting on flap angle based on heave feedback.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">5.1 Sensitivity Studies</h3>
      <p>
        Several simulation campaigns explore how control parameters affect flight:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <strong>Gearing Sensitivity Study:</strong> how different wand gearings
          change foil immersion, ride-height stability and upwind VMG in flat
          and wave conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wand Length Sensitivity Study:</strong> how changing wand length
          biases the mean flight level and interacts with ride-height offset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heave PID Controller Study:</strong> tuning K<sub>p</sub>,
          K<sub>i</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> to balance rise time, overshoot
          and disturbance rejection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparison Study:</strong> direct comparison between tuned
          wand configurations and a tuned PID in both flat water and regular waves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          The <strong>PID</strong> offers shorter settling time and better disturbance
          rejection, especially in waves, leading to more stable ride height and
          trim in the tested conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>wand system</strong> is mechanically simple and robust, and
          its behaviour is mainly driven by gearing (effective loop gain) and wand
          length (mean flight height).
        </li>
        <li>
          Electronic ride-height control is currently <strong>not allowed</strong> by the
          International Moth Class Rules, so the PID pathway is relevant mainly
          for training, experimental work and potential future rule changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK -->
    <section id="conclusions" class="section">
      <h2>6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        The project shows that a DVPP-based simulator such as SiM can host a
        credible International Moth test platform. Within the tested envelope,
        the model reproduces D3-VPP performance, captures expected controller trends
        and provides a repeatable environment for flight-control development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limitations mainly concern the restricted operating range (TWS, TWA and
        sea states), simplified aero models and the absence of crew dynamics or
        manoeuvres. Future work should:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Broaden the matrix of TWS/TWA and sea conditions (including irregular seas).</li>
        <li>Refine wand mechanism modelling (springs, damping, friction, etc.).</li>
        <li>Develop more advanced PID tuning, with anti-windup and fail-safe interfaces.</li>
        <li>Incorporate crew dynamics, manoeuvres and validation against on-water data.</li>
      </ul>

        Within these limits, the SiM-Moth platform justifies its role as a development
